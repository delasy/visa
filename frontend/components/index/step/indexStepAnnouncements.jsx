        A visa to the Russian Federation is a document, permitting stay in Russia for a specific period of time.
        Visa lists entry/exit dates, your name, passport details, and a purpose of travel. Please note, that your
        Russian visa is an exit permit just like itâ€™s an entry permit: if you lose it or stay over your designated
        departure date, leaving the country could be more troublesome than entering it. For more information about
